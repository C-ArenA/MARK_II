====================

This project is under hard development. For more information, send me an email.

MARK II is system on chip written in VHDL, it have custom 32bit CPU and few peripherials.
Also there is a few tools written in Python.

-----------
- [ ] Write better documentation.
- [ ] SDRAM controller.
- [ ] Interface board (VGA, PS2, RS232...).
- [ ] Improve support for macros in assembler.
- [ ] Check status messages of all tools. Improve them.
