\section{Peripherals}

\subsection{RAM}

Simple and fast memory. You can store your data there, you can also run program
from there.

Internal RAM is organized as 32bit wide words and is implemented with internal
SRAM block memory in FPGA. Thus is really fast. It is fastest memory what you
can use (of course, except registers).

\subsection{ROM}

Simple memory for program store. CPU can read program from this but it is not
able to write data there.

Memory is implemented in same way as RAM, but write signals is not present
there. Content of ROM is specified in ".mif" memory initialization files. These
files are used during synthesis of SoC into FPGA.

\subsection{GPIO}
Simple peripheral, two 8bit input/outputs ports. Function is similar
to AVR ports, there is two register, DDR and PORT, logical one in DDR
set this pin as output, value written into right bit of PORT register
will be on pin. When logical zero in in DDR register, CPU can read
values what are connected to the pins through PORT register.

\subsection{UART}

\subsection{Interrupt driver}

\subsection{Timer}

\subsection{System timer}

\subsection{VGA driver}

\subsection{PS2 driver}
