\subsection{Interrupts}

Interrupt vectors are address in memory where the CPU will jump when interrupt
occur. These vectors can be changed using interrupt driver. When
interrupt occur CPU will do following:

1. complete actual instruction
2. increment PC (PC always have to point to next instruction)
3. store PC into stack and decrement SP
4. jump into interrupt vector

At the end of ISR one have to use RETI instruction. This instruction will
inform interrupt driver that ISR is completed and CPU is ready to take another
interrupt. There is no support for nested interrupts. When first interrupt
come, another have to wait.
