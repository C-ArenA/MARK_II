\subsection{ROM}

Simple memory for program store. CPU can read program from this but it is not
able to write data there.

Memory is implemented in same way as RAM, but write signals is not present
there. Content of ROM is specified in ".mif" memory initialization files. These
files are used during synthesis of SoC into FPGA.
