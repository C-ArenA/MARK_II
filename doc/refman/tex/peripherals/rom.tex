\subsection{ROM}

\subsubsection{Introduction}

Simple memory for program store. CPU can read program from this but it is not
able to write data there. By default, in rom0 is stored serial port loader and
CPU start execution there.

Memory is implemented in same way as RAM, but write signals is not present
there. Content of ROM is specified in ".mif" memory initialization files. These
files are used during synthesis of SoC into FPGA.

\subsubsection{Hacking}

At this moment, there is any simple way to change size of ROM. It is hard coded
to 256 words. In order to change it you have to modify chip select generator,
instance of lpm\_rom and mif.

Anyway, you can change memory initialization file quit simply. Just replace
"rom.mif" file in the /fpga/src/rom/ directory. New file should be organized
as 256x32bit.
