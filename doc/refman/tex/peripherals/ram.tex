\subsection{RAM}

Simple and fast memory. You can store your data there, you can also run program
from there.

Internal RAM is organized as 32bit wide words and is implemented with internal
SRAM block memory in FPGA. Thus is really fast. It is fastest memory what you
can use (of course, except registers).
