\subsection{SDRAM}

This is simple peripheral like any others on-chip RAM but it use 
external memory device. Used memory is IS42S16160B that can be found on 
board DE0 Nano.

\subsubsection{Function}

Usage is same as any other RAM, external sdram chip is configured 
automatically and this process is transparent for CPU. But at power-up, 
it take about $200 \mu s$ to configure sdram chip.

\subsubsection{Hacking}

Unlike on-chip RAM, you are not able to initialize addition SDRAM driver. 
Used memory chip is also hardwired into driver and if you want use 
different, you have to modify FSM in file 
fpga/src/sdram/sdram\_driver.vhd.
