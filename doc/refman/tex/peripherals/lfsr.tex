\subsection{LFSR}

Very primitive peripheral containing free running shift register with 
linear feedback that can be used for generating pseudo random numbers.

\subsubsection{Function}

You simply read data register and that is. There is nothing to set-up. 
Feedback is $x^{32} + x^{22} + x^{2} + x^{1} + 1$, that is sequence 
with 4294967295 states.

\subsubsection{Registers}

There is only one register, called LFSR\_RN, and it have offset $+0$. It 
is read only and contain pseudonymous number.
