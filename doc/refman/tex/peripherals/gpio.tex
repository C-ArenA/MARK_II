\subsection{GPIO}
Simple peripheral, two 8bit input/outputs ports. Function is similar
to AVR ports, there is two register, DDR and PORT, logical one in DDR
set this pin as output, value written into right bit of PORT register
will be on pin. When logical zero in in DDR register, CPU can read
values what are connected to the pins through PORT register.
